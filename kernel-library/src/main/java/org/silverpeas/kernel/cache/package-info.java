/**
 * Provides an API to manage caches whatever their implementation. A cache is an efficient way to
 * store objects in order to retrieve them later without having to get them from an external
 * datasource (database, filesystem, ...) or to recreate them. According to the implementation a
 * cache can also be shared between several runtimes allowing consequently load-balancing. In a
 * cache, an object is stored as a key-value pair in which the key is used to identify and hence to
 * refer the stored object, and the value is the object itself.
